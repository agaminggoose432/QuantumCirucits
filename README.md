# Welcome to my repo
**Find below some important info for understanding this repo.** 
This is more of an archive for me and something other people can refer to to learn more about Quantum Computing

## QisKit

### What is QisKit?
Qiskit is a python library that as stated on their website: "Qiskit is an open-source SDK for working with quantum computers at the level of extended quantum circuits, operators, and primitives."
This allows us to simulate a basic quantum computer or just a quantum circuit which is mainly what this repo is comprised of.

### How do I install QisKit

## Quantum Computers 

### What is Quantum Computing (QC)
Quantum computing is a concept that use sub-atomic particles to perform calculations.
Instead of using bits like a regular computer QC's use Qubits which are just subatomic particles, these qubits act similar to regular bits in how they can be 1 or 0 but they can also be inbetween one of these state which is refferred to as a superposition.

Regular computers give 1 output for certain but quantum computers give a percentage to be the correct answer.
Quantum computing doesnt have many uses right now but it can easily crask RSA encryption much faster than any regular computer.

### Interference
Quantum computers have to be kept cold, VERY cold. If even a small maount of external heat gets in it causes **Interference** which can cause incorrect results.
